21 November 2021,Princess Nicole Salita," I suggest you to add something like a highlighter, so that students who cannot print out and copy all of the modules can hilight important things inside for easier reviewing."
18 November 2021,Bryan Seare, Needs bug fixes. Its stability is just not there.
17 November 2021,SophiaDraco," consistently logs me out. my school uses Google to sign in, which would make things convinent, except for the fact that you can't use an account already on your phone. you need to sign in to your Google every time. also the app caches a lot which is :("
16 November 2021,Michael Spiering," Doesn't have very much customization. Doesn't save notification log or assignments so you chew up a lot of data. I would like assignments to show if they are worth more or less parts of my total grade. It's a good tool, but it needs a lot of work."
16 November 2021,Pedro Pacheco," This app is borderline unusable. It is very slow so its just easier to open the browser and log in. Also, unlike the web version, it doesn't let you know when exams or assignments are still ungraded. It shows a 0. Needlessly alarming."
9 November 2021,Susan Young," App stopped working - won't let me log in. I can sign in to the website, but when I downloaded the app to a new device it will not move past the Choose your school name panel."
5 November 2021,"Maruhom, Abdul whalid", The apps is good but Its always have a bug.
4 November 2021,Hafiz Rusli," Some of the language does not supported, instead some kind of weird other languages are mix together to form an unreadable phase or sentence. Now im curious what my teachers just replay to my assignment. Pls fix it okaii?"
2 November 2021,LPS; PawsOn, SLOW IT SUCKS
30 October 2021,Veronika Kaverina, 1. It can't find my school even tho I typed in my schools full name correctly! 2. And I already have this app on my school computer so I don't even need this app on my phone nor iPad.
28 October 2021,David, Should be possible to easily open the desktop version despite having installed the app. The app unfortunately still lacks too many features.

27 October 2021,Chu Zwei, It has been continuously logging me out of my account and I don't know why please fix this so I could rate you better.
27 October 2021,Drew Mortenson," Consistently forgets my school, wont let me load my school page, fails to load, fails to upload documents, etc. It's actually disturbing to me that colleges use canvas. Im just scared of having to use blackboard, because canvas is bad and people say blackboard is worse."
23 October 2021,Jeru Sanders," I shouldn't get redirected to leave a review when trying to check my grades. I'll be ignoring all ""surveys"" from now on."
23 October 2021,Selena Y., It's easy access if I don't have my laptop. Half of the time the app doesn't match with the website- fix that.

23 October 2021,Xan JG, This app need more updates like you can upload a video for your class. Like the real canvas from internet.
22 October 2021,Ipomoea Draco," Before Canvas, I used to have mostly A's. I only had 1 B grade, and that's it!

Now that the classes I need to take are partially or fully reliant on Canvas, my grades are dropping. Student submissions are missing or hidden, and I cannot interact until they replied back! There were no unread replies in the Discussions tab. This buggy mess of a student app is ruining my GPA, thus ruining my chances to transfer to the Art Center in the future."
21 October 2021,Anant Bisht, Has bugs. Shows assignments as an overlay on the menu its opened from.

I couldn't get myself to participate in any group discussions because it lack the feature to do so. I couldn't collaborate, my replies disappear after I type it. Canvas Help Discussions doesn't help either when their only solutions is to do something outside of Canvas, when the App can't even provide the handful of services Desktop has. Leaving at 2 stars, until Replies and Assignments are fixed and don't disappear, and add Collaborations, Chat, & edit reply."

On a laptop it may show a new notification bubble over the app icon (only sometimes), but when the app opens there will be no sign of what the notification is, what class it was for, etc. Frustrating when you need to know what's going on in your courses."

14 October 2021,Jaden Woodward, Love ease of access. Please add option to switch to list view. I use the desktop shortcut instead solely for this reason.
13 October 2021,David Brown, Notifications are broken. I get notifications from 2 semesters ago and so I just disabled them all. There's also no way to mark multiple messages as read.
11 October 2021,Karl Walker, There are still small minor bug fixes that should be made.
11 October 2021,Lindsay Wolfgramm," It's fantastic when its working. However, it logs me out often then it's difficult to log in afterwards. I tired resetting my password but during the verification image process, it never loads afterwards."

8 October 2021,Jacob Over, Impossible to use on mobile
8 October 2021,Thomas Worrell," How can an app specifically made to help students keep up with their classes, not allow students to view comments on their assignments. It notifies you about comments, but you can't view them in the app! Basically making it useless."
7 October 2021,Luke LaValle," App works ok, but Everytime there is an announcement or anything, I get at least 6 notifications. Very annoying"

28 September 2021,John Dupuis, Doesn't differentiate between instructor account and student account. Tons of missing features.

20 September 2021,Paul Kendall, this app sucks
19 September 2021,William Muhlbach," Notifications are not sorted into channels, which makes it difficult to deal with them. The in-app web browser kinda sucks, there should be an option to open links in the device's default browser, like there is in most other apps."

18 August 2021,Autumn Holch, Can not sign in.
16 August 2021,Maka Dolidze, You need to develope the app and make it possible to have two different school accaunts in one app. Not everyone stydies at just one place. Stay updated and think a bit more.
14 August 2021,Ashley Olson," I liked this app last semester. It could be better but I like getting notified when an assignment gets graded or a teacher sends out a message, but after the most recent update I just get an error message every time I click on my college."

6 August 2021,Mark Yumul, I think this app is collecting our personal information.... For some reason whenever i search in google i always see the logo of canvas instead google.
6 August 2021,hehe, each page takes forever to load. every page including start up and all the other menus. a waste of time especially when I am in the rush

29 June 2021,Michelle Gale, Videos are not able to play through the app (only in web browser and I see no way to open in video in the browser through the app). This is very frustrating when trying to keep up with lectures.

As a parent who is active in my child's academic life it's frustrating that I can see CURRENT and UPCOMING assignments to help keep him on track. I only recently found out from my child that his assignments are actually done on something called ""class kick""??? Which I knew nothing about. Apparently class kick and canvas go hand in hand. I feel if parents are expected to use these platforms we need ALL PIECES. Not parts. Very frustrating."
