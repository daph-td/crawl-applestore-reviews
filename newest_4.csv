18 November 2021,Austin B. Crawford," Excellent, most functions work well except for when trying to display websites or documents in the app."
16 November 2021,Ildiko Barrett," Hard at first to get your head around, but once you get it, you've got it."
16 November 2021,Seth Budrik, Great App. Haven't had any real issues with it.
14 November 2021,Tabby Kitten," The interface is confusing and it's hard to navigate. But otherwise a good app, don't get me wrong.

My small idiot brain loves the animation that plays when an assignment is turned in. It is easy to use, but still hard for my very limited braincells to figure out. Bonus points for confetti that I already mentioned."
12 November 2021,Anthony Cottle, It works! It needs a group function though
10 November 2021,Fuzzy Bunny," Good but there's a bug where even if you filter for q1 or q1, it still shows everything."
9 November 2021,Addison Cooper, Canvas App is great for submitting photos of work!
9 November 2021,William Hester IV, Works great all except for the calendar never loads for me
7 November 2021,iyalekhue Endurance, Awesome app and easy to use. Makes assignment easily and quickly accessible on a mobile device. It is easier than using a browser. Discussion Boards just have to be improved.
7 November 2021,Stephen Mills," Better than Bboard, therrs a big diff b/n the. Mobile and online versions"
5 November 2021,Kaylah Ogden," Great for doing school work on the go, but I wish it was available on the fire tablet. A phone isn't quiet but enough."
5 November 2021,Jennifer Guyton, Good
2 November 2021,Janine Gonzaga," After I take the quiz I have to exit the whole app because the back option doesn't work. Plus, my professors have uploaded so many tasks to do! OMG"
1 November 2021,Ray St Valen, Great!!For an old student like me
27 October 2021,Gavin Skeen, convenient i guess
26 October 2021,Michael Fujii, Works ok. See class material. Submit assignments. Email professor. External links usually work.
26 October 2021,Tommy Stephen, Love being able to keep track of what our student is doing.
26 October 2021,Isaac Cromwell, Good That's about it
25 October 2021,TeslaInvestah," A capable app. Can do 95% of what the desktop site can, but rarely a page can't load.

The loading animation will just spin forever if you don't realize that your internet is turned off. Aaah. Also, I wish that dismissing canvas notifications from the notification bar disabled those notifications from being regenerated whenever the phone restarts. It always spams me with the same old 70 spastic almost-simultaneous vibrations when I turn on my phone. Perhaps I am just using it wrong."
24 October 2021,Linda Pleskaƒçov√°," If I hadn't have to log in almost every time I open the app, it would be for 5 stars."
23 October 2021,gwen l fitzgerald-barlow, Wasn't able to do the survey due to app not responding
22 October 2021,Eron KM, It's good and easy to use just that it's hard to turn off notifications. So your email gets a lot of notifications. Other than that it's a great app.
21 October 2021,Mariam Bawatnih," Excellent, but calendar is not loading recently!"
20 October 2021,Michael Garmon, This app is very helpful as a student. It is great to submit assignments on the same device I scan. It would be great if it had a built in scanner. I would help me reduce the amount of files I have in my drive.
19 October 2021,Bryan Taylor," Missing some features compared to it's browser counterpart. The two work decently together, though. I mainly use this for checking grades."
18 October 2021,William Cox, Works great in conjunction with school/class
17 October 2021,Lisa Thomas-Walker, Great üëç
15 October 2021,Kristopher Malan, The only thing I would add is put a feature so you can arrange the flash cards in an order of your choosing
13 October 2021,hmallanigue, Needs improvement. Not user friendly esp not student friendly.
12 October 2021,Angelito Ambos, It's have a very good program and fast loading
12 October 2021,Madalitso Chipembere, Its super and easy to follow
12 October 2021,Dragon Slayer, It's alright. At least it semi works. I'm kinda forced to use it but I could think of worse things I could be forced to use.
12 October 2021,Matthew Velez, Ban school
12 October 2021,Arkar Chan, Gud
11 October 2021,Caroline Van't Land," Sometimes crashes unexpectedly on my tablet, but other than that it works great for school!"

I like it because instead of always having to type in my screenname and password every time I want to look at something or do an assignment, when I use the app all I have to do is click on it and it takes me right to my classes and the app also shows me when certain homework assignments are do and also when quizzes/exams are going to be. The only problem I have had the past few weeks is that when I click on the ""to do"" tab it will say it's empty even though luckily I already know that I still have assignments that are due. So when it says that it's empty, it is extremely misleading. Hopefully it will be fixed. Other than that I think the app is great! I use it everyday."
5 October 2021,mary opeyemi, It was awesome experience using this app
5 October 2021,Ryan, Slightly better user experience needed but a great accompaniment to the system
4 October 2021,Madss Urias, It a good app for my school and easy to use
4 October 2021,Jayden Daniel, G√ºd
2 October 2021,Mr Mech," Can canvas create or make the wrongs visible, I mean just wrongs not the whole exam or quiz,.. so we can review it?"
2 October 2021,Teddy Ward, Fair easy to use
2 October 2021,Bety Solis, Okay.
1 October 2021,Ida Harris, direct and simple to use
1 October 2021,Pie Shack, the pill
30 September 2021,Tabby Cat," It's great I can do homework on my phone, but it doesn't have everything that the Chromebooks do"
29 September 2021,Christian Mabe," Works okay most of the time. My biggest issue is that when you're on your to-do list, it prevents you from clicking on the top buttons. You have to reload the page to do so. It's minor, but really frustrates you after the four hundredth time."
29 September 2021,Iva Mendhy, Useful
28 September 2021,Paula Taylor," Can't open class videos, but everything else is good"
28 September 2021,M a O, You're trying to hard. Having the buttons on the bottom screen is terrible and is in the way. Better if relocated to the top of the screen.
27 September 2021,Jan Good," I like this for my schoolwork, its easy to use. I wish it had a dark mode though."
27 September 2021,Stacey Smith, App is easy to use. Not all teachers post information the same way or grades consistently.
26 September 2021,Brennon Wax," Overall pretty good just needs some small improvements. For example, when writing discussions you can write and can no longer refer to previous posts. Another problem is that the due dates for assignments are off by 1 day."
25 September 2021,Vio let, How do i use big blue button? It won't work on my phone
23 September 2021,Jessi Reynolds," Pretty easy to navigate and get to my important stuff so far.

I think it would be cool if it had a ""slide to see schedule"" so you could quickly see your class schedule. Sometimes getting to see your class schedule takes a lot of steps and it would be nice to just be able to see it without having to login and jump through hoops. Just a suggestion... Overall, keep up the great work!"
22 September 2021,Lex Icon," could use more polish, but essential to my success in school"
22 September 2021,K Payne, Great to use for when you are on the go. Although some features are not the same as if you were online on a web browser.
22 September 2021,Giuseppe DeFazio, Good for school notifications. Not missing any dye dates
21 September 2021,Lucia ≈†ikulov√°," The app works surprisingly well, including as much of the web interface as possible even on smartphone screens.

However, it is missing the groups section under people quite acutely, especially since because of corona a lot of important information about class attendance possibilities is there. I cannot think of anything else that should be fixed, I hope sometime soon this can happen :)"
20 September 2021,Marco Rodas," Great as you get info faster than traditional (1995ish) method. Still, info only as good as what's input and updated. Maybe I'm spoiled but I want to see my assignments graded in 4 days or less. Yes, everyone is busy and yes, have to be patient. Blame Amazon, I guess."
20 September 2021,Joe Braun," Does everything essential, but misses some fringe marks. This app is the go-to choice for using canvas on mobile.

This app is the go-to choice for using canvas on mobile. Animations are smooth, things are well placed, and the only overall UX detractor is lack of a dark mode. That said, some small features available on the web app are not present in this version. Future enrollments, for example, are not visible under ""All Courses."" A student might mistake this oversight as failure to enroll on their part and cause unnecessary panic."
19 September 2021,Alyssa Cuesta," Great app! Just like the website, but my calendar always reads ERROR and I am unable to access the calendar! :/"
19 September 2021,‚Ä¢Ghouly Gacha‚Ä¢, Why I need this? I don't know. My school sucks.
18 September 2021,rasam zamani, Some features doesn't work in the app
18 September 2021,Aviance Collins, Downloading Canvas is not the best. It is better if I go through my school to Canvas. The actual app has a few problems but it is manageable.
17 September 2021,NightWolf787, Good for school but can be a but slow
17 September 2021,Matteo N√∫√±ez," Good app, I would like to have the same features I have on PC"
15 September 2021,CCaffie, it'd be nice to have an option to submit camera pictures as pdfs
14 September 2021,Ivana Lozano, I used canvas for school. It comes in handy when you are out and you can check tour grades. Especially if you have an art class you submit your work in.
13 September 2021,jules-ferry toussom kameni, Very helpful and easy for sending homeworks.
12 September 2021,Edward Loboda," Can't access groups thru the app, otherwise it is great üëç"
11 September 2021,Parmesan Glitter, It's an app for school and stuff. It's good
10 September 2021,Sara Cruz, Makes doing homework easy
9 September 2021,Iaine-Zachery Richardson, Could give it a five star if the widgets all worked. Grades and To Do don't work.
9 September 2021,TO's Ha, Very nice considering that I don't use it often. It's great for getting work done
8 September 2021,Neon Link plasma, This is very nice app but it freezers when i do my assignments please fix.
8 September 2021,JotGaming, Works well.
7 September 2021,cece, It works i just didn't get it working bc for like 2 whole weeks bc the app was malfunctioning ü§°
3 September 2021,Ethan Matzdorf," Pretty good. Does glitch up sometimes with submissions and viewing documents, but overall a solid app for what it is. It's certainly the best school-resource app that I have used as a student."
3 September 2021,Theresa Vasquez, I am doing well with the canvas I can turn this into my teachers
2 September 2021,SoLZ 2 .0, I can't change my password but it's cool
2 September 2021,akhlaq khan, Great üëç
31 August 2021,janet njambi, Very convenient and easy to use.
31 August 2021,Aldrin Lloyd Tanda Eduvane, The best
30 August 2021,Billy Smith," Good app, if I could make a suggestion it would be extremely handy to receive a notification when an assignment has been marked/commented on so you don't have to hunt through all your work to find out which requires more work or responding to your training supervisor."
25 August 2021,kiwi Randoms, Great for school a lil different from going in through vportal tho so be prepared for that otherwise no complaints it's just as easy to use
25 August 2021,Mathew Alcober, The app is good but there are some things that should be polished. The BBB should be optimized such that it should be a mobile friendly video calling platform. The app itself should have an option for dark mode.
25 August 2021,James Chin, Good
24 August 2021,Chiedza Dziruni, Pretty good
23 August 2021,Brady Harrison," As much as I hate the feeling of notifications about missing assignments, I have to say that it does a really nice job of reworking the pc website to fit mobile."
23 August 2021,Marc Hills, The refresh button on the widgets do not work.
22 August 2021,Duncan Johnson," I like being able to check assignments and messages from my teachers and this is generally a good app. I wish that there was a month view in the calendar tab like there is on the webpage, because it's confusing to try and check all of my school work by the day that the assignments are due."
19 August 2021,R Davis, Easy to use... My only complaint is there is a class from spring 2021 that I can't remove from my app. That really bothers me...
19 August 2021,Shane McLaughlin, I really love this app and all it has to offer. Have found it extremely helpful when I don't have access to my desktop.

The only complaint I have is that you can't change the timezone. I attend school online that is in a different state and am 3 hours ahead of them. That makes the calender on my phone say I have something due on a Wednesday when it is really due on Tuesday night. I know this seems minor but it would be really cool if it could be changed on the app.
18 August 2021,Kymani Islam, Gud
17 August 2021,Nike P√©rez, Genial
17 August 2021,Mayank Singh, Great
11 August 2021,Jaquelyn Miranda-rivera, This app has helped me alot with school and i hope it helps you to it doesnt contain ads or any interuptions during your classes. It will tell you if your missing something or if there is a zoom on. I hope you enjoy this app thanks for reading byeee

6 August 2021,Amber, Very helpful for keeping track of my course work and grades when away from my computer. Runs smoothly and I haven't had any issues yet.
5 August 2021,Felicia Henley, Great for checking in but discussions posts cannot be edited nor can groups be seen.
3 August 2021,Arnold Dickens Joseph, Reliable
30 July 2021,Ashley McBride, This app is a great way to stay current with discussions and announcements for school.
29 July 2021,Jacob D, Great app as a student. Only issue I have is once courses are finished you're unable to remove them from your widget dashboard which causes it to become clustered with classes I'm no longer enrolled in
29 July 2021,Jacqueline Jauregui," Get in contact with professors, have grades and assignments visible when graded and assigned. Upcoming events on calendar and reminders can be set along with a to do list for missed assignments. It is very handy!!"
28 July 2021,Christopher Segovia, Works pretty well. Can't watch video lectures which is a bit obnoxious but otherwise easy to use
25 July 2021,Solatasi, Easy to use
20 July 2021,Daniel James, Great app - NEEDS dark mode please! Then it would be 5 stars.

10 June 2021,B0nfire_157, It is alot easier to go on the app then to search it up and I suggest it to people who go onto Canvas alot but I cant seem to make a bookmark and they don't have ads so that is also amazing.

9 June 2021,A human Being," Easy to use, but dashboard does not put everything up so always always check your calendar before assuming you've got no work. Or depending on how much your teacher hates your existence you might have to go into their modules."
8 June 2021,Rachel Brown, Too complicated to navigate.
7 June 2021,Jared Daniel Recomendable, Good and speedy experience to use. Would have preferred if tablet layout is available for Chrome OS and Android tablets.
3 June 2021,Perplexive," Very easy to use, but please show undated assignments directly on the calendar, at least when they will be unavailable. It is annoying that there are no emails and notifications regarding undated quizzes, and then a few days later I receive a notification from a teacher. But the rest is good."
3 June 2021,E&A Stardust," does most things very well. It would be good if there were more special characters for math. Also, why not allow emojis and discussion and messaging system?"

20 April 2021,Trisha Crossman, Never really have had issues with the Canvas app and I have been using about 1 1/2 years. It comes with it's flaws but I mostly use it to check grades or work that still needs done. Discussions are a pain but again I use my laptop for that kind of stuff so it automatically saves just in case.

30 March 2021,Abhijeet singh, Best app

9 December 2020,Andrew Siegel, I'm editing my review because overall Canvas is pretty reliable and has been working pretty well lately.
9 December 2020,Ra'Anaa Burney, Handy app
8 December 2020,Michelle Jamison," It's starting to pick up traction by online learning institutes and even traditional classroom instructors use it more. It's still not as friendly or intuitive as I would like. But once you figure out and learn where everything is, it's fine."
7 December 2020,Rachael Hubnik, I wish there was an option so you could block the user from going to any web pages that are not a part of the class or program.

I tried to use an app blocker while my child was on canvas but it ended up blocking a part of canvas so my child couldn't do her school work until I disabled the app blocker. Then she was able to surf the internet.
5 December 2020,Jgouken," Getting better. Updates are fixing bugs that i hd a problem with and the app is becoming more stable. It's a good app for students and parents, but that doesn't mean it's the best."
5 December 2020,Genesis X, It's pretty good. Just one thing that really irratates is the video player. The videos played through Canvas buffer a LOT. And it's not my connection. My connection is good. The video player needs improvement.
5 December 2020,Dadiso Chitengwa, GUI could be better on mobile.
4 December 2020,isa bele," its cool, but I want to see my grade"
3 December 2020,Troy Russo," It works fine. My main grievances are that checking the grades on a phone is different than the computer, and worse. Also the to do section doesn't show assignments that have no due date, so it can seem like there is no work to do when there is."

The only thing I found trouble with sorting my grades by trimester, for some reason instead of showing all of what I did in my current trimester it shows all of last trimester and this trimester. This makes it very hard to find an assignment and check its grades. Also I haven't been able to find a way to get notifications to work on my phone."

20 November 2020,Phoebe Bakker, I don't like it because it makes me do homework but I do like it because I can get my work done on my phone
20 November 2020,Destiny Robar, I would say its 4 out of 5 because it does not always work and it is some what organaized
20 November 2020,Luke Kesoglou, This app at a first glance may be very complex and difficult to use. But after a few days you get used to it.

15 September 2020,Rubaiyat Tasnim Rashid," I dont know why but even after changing the settings on Canvas, I dont get notifications for any announcements or any grades posted. Not only me, but to a friend as well. ZERO notifications from Canvas when its an important app for school. I hope youll fix this issue soon."
15 September 2020,Cynthia Patience Oyella, Dope
15 September 2020,Nikhil Teja," Canvas was great in the beginning for the online classes. But now, it became too damn slow. To join a session it is taking 15 - 20 minutes (ended up missing the classes and is very annoying üòë)."
15 September 2020,William Castile, Tough to use at first but you get the hang of it fast.
15 September 2020,naakane," It's a pretty good app easy to navigate and pull up all my class work, though I wish it would send more notifications sometimes I dont get any notices."
15 September 2020,Alessandra Roza, Canvas is excellent but does not have the option to 'raise the hand'
14 September 2020,Molly Sue, The app works well just doesn't have some of the same options the apple version does. My teacher wanted us to scan our work and submit it through the app and I don't have that option.
14 September 2020,Cecillia Corrales, Works pretty well. Sometimes it glitches out but not too bad. It's convenient on the go.
13 September 2020,Qui," Downloads always fail whenever I leave the app. It's a waste of time waiting for the file to download, especially with slow internet connection. Hopefully the app developers let downloads continue in the background. It would be really helpful for us students."
13 September 2020,Gabby McGuire," Love it, makes online classes very easy!"
12 September 2020,Caitlin Carle," Frustrated that after a recent update, the text field when in a reply (specifically a reply, not a new message), doesn't allow predictive text. It seems to be interpreted (by all keyboards on my phone) as a non-predictive field. Makes typing back to students cumbersome."
11 September 2020,Sam Regalia, Good enough but has its times where it doesnt wanna work
11 September 2020,Maddy W, Dark mode please :)
11 September 2020,Jose Alfredo, I use this app a lot and the only quark I have with it is that it would be nice to swipe between announcements from the instructor. It annoying having to go through the visual similar announcements. A swipe feature would be great on both the app and the website. Other than that it's been amazing.
11 September 2020,Emmanuel Asamoah Adjei, I give it 4 stars because of the interface. I think it should be the same as it is on iPhone.
10 September 2020,Karkle Is Dead," The app isn't terrible. It's formatting is meh and it gives me so much school work I feel like I'm gonna puke sometimes, but it does what it should."

7 September 2020,Darvin Enriquez, notifications are not accurate
7 September 2020,Rick Valdez-Preciado," Good interface, Id say my only issue would be the compatibility with my chromebook. Some docs need to be opened via the web rather than the app. Besides that, everything is great!"
6 September 2020,Leah Elborn, Great to use. Can access a lot of my work. Sometimes I have trouble accessing the library though. It could conflicts with browser

30 August 2020,Dwayne deLung, Works surprisingly well
28 August 2020,Amanda Lauver, Overall good app to supplement desktop website. Wish there was a feature to toggle to unread responses in discussion boards though. It can get pretty tiresome scrolling to read a new comment or post.

26 August 2020,Evona Higby, I would have to say that I have not had any issues as of yet. I am happy with what I am able to do and no disruptive updates.

Kindly make the Login API available on the first start! Otherwise Great app..!!
21 August 2020,Matt Deno, I find it frustrating that we cannot edit our discussion board comments using the app unlike those used on the web site. This is a major oversight to the discussion and editing process used by students.

19 August 2020,Jazz G, I love this canvas app. It makes accessing my classes so much easier and faster. Playing videos on the app did cause me some issues though. Although I could watch my lectures there were some technical issues once in a while.I would just go to my school canvas web page to watch my lectures.
19 August 2020,Izzabella Dagli, How can i delete my comments?
18 August 2020,Krystal Yim, I generally don't use it that much but I have a recommendation of letting students pin assignments from the modules to the top of the page and/or make their own custom to do list with description

Making it hard to response back. And sometime you can not open up the webpage it provides you with.

29 April 2020,R.," An incredibly useful way to have quick and easy access to your grades, course handouts, other students in the class, and much more. However, effectiveness of the service is pretty dependent on your instructor's use and familiarity with the service."
28 April 2020,Isaiah Dewberry, Good

26 April 2020,Cameron Harvey, It works fine but pdfs are annoying sometimes
25 April 2020,muklar2 _," As far as I know Canvas on phones works perfectly hence the 4 stars. But, on a computer it's way worse. Simply some pages won't load at all, you have to go to about 2 pages to see something that was supposed to be shown at a click."
25 April 2020,Alissa Tran," I use this app regularly for school, especially with the quarantine underway and all classes are online. It works pretty well. Easy to upload and get notifications. Using the browser version works just as well, though."

24 April 2020,Rajeev Sebastian, It works well as a basic application to check your scores and everything but is slower than the website in loading modules files or things like that. Would prefer the desktop site over this
22 April 2020,Jacob Cox," The only reason it's a 4-star is because sometimes when I open the app it still shows my home screen but the canvas symbol is in front of it. I clicked the square button and it showed my home screen with the canvas symbol in front as the canvas app. Can you fix that, developers?"
22 April 2020,Perla Berlanga," So far, this app has been very efficient. Very easy to use, especially when I'm out and about, when I get the time I'll get on it and am able to finish my assignments, without having to wait."
22 April 2020,Steven Hager," Great, well organized"
21 April 2020,Celeste Lau, I really like the app but would love to be able to add tasks to the to-do list. It would really help to manage my other school commitments and break up school assignments into parts. Thanks!
21 April 2020,Riley Barnett," I want a send work page, some difficulty submitting work but thats just me. This app makes communication easy, but I would like an alert (ringtone) for mobile."
20 April 2020,Mary Ann Carmicheal," I use this app all the time and mostly enjoy the experiance. I would, however like to see the same features on the app as online.

If these issues were fixed I would have no problems giving it 5 stars."
20 April 2020,Michelle Guerline Sama, The app was fine at first but then it started like not showing words like assignments so it was really hard to get your assignments done

I was doing a test just a few seconds ago when I got to the last question and being kinda dumb spammed the next button. As I realized it was dumb to click next and tried to go back to the quiz to fix some answers it crashed on me... Will you please fix the crashes.
