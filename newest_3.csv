I do think Google Classroom is a little bit better, because it is easier to create assignments (according to my social studies teacher), and it is just a little less confusing for the students because Canvas has more things that you are able to click on, that just aren't useful at all. It also took me, like, a month after downloading it for it to actually let me sign in. So yeah, it is pretty good, but it could be better"

It has great animations and it is pretty easy to navigate and understand. It handles attachments and files extremely well. I've never had an abiguous moment regarding submissions. It makes it quite clear how week the upload is and if it fails. One request: Viewing attached files in discussion posts is confusing. It's not clear where to tap to access them. Then, the download progress of the file is hidden."
24 October 2021,Lyndsey Wolfe," My calendar feature hasn't worked in months but no one I know is having issues with theirs.

Mine says ""There was an error loading your calendar"" with a ""Retry"" button but it doesn't matter how many times I retry, it doesn't work. The To-do list feature works but I hate that, I want my calendar back. I've even tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app and nothing works. Also, a really smart feature to have would be the ability to set reminders or notifications for upcoming calendar due dates."
16 November 2021,Ajay Kumar," App works farily well, but there are still a few issues.

Something minor but annoying is the when adding a file to submit with the panda on a stool, the text overlaps and looks weird. Overall annoying minor issues but it gets the job done."

It is also useful when needing to contact classmates rather having to open up an email account and formatting a message via email. The app does forward an alert that someone has sent you a message via email. This app has a vast list of schools that you can connect to your schools system. It is really a great app!"
21 November 2021,Val W," Meh app I like that I can see each class on my dashboard. Sadly, I am unable to do much else. The calendar does not function, I can not do quizzes or submit assignments, and often the mailing function fails. I am glad I only use this occasionally. If I had to rely on it I would fail miserably."

8 November 2021,Liza Liza," CANVAS is extremely UNintuitive and NOT user-friendly. It's a linear system and quite annoying and time wasting to use. You have to keep going back to one specific page to go to the page you want. Most of the time you can't find what you are looking because it's not where you'd expect it to be.

You have to keep going back to one specific page to go to the page you want. Most of the time you can't find what you are looking because it's not where you'd expect it to be. Also, it gives you no warning when you're about to start a test! If you accidentally press ""next"" there's no way back or out. There should be a permanent link to BRAINFUSE!"

It takes too long to pause if we need to catch up, and it is a royal pain to jump back if we missed an important word or two (especially on longer videos.) It's making studying a real chore."
3 November 2021,Josie Turner," Calendar function doesn't work on mobile. Hasn't worked for roughly a year. Wish they would fix this. Everything else is fine, I just use the calendar a lot and it's annoying that it never works for me. I see that looking through the reviews it isn't only me who is affected either."

It always spams me with the same old 70 spastic almost-simultaneous vibrations when I turn on my phone. Perhaps I am just using it wrong."

I like it because instead of always having to type in my screenname and password every time I want to look at something or do an assignment, when I use the app all I have to do is click on it and it takes me right to my classes and the app also shows me when certain homework assignments are do and also when quizzes/exams are going to be. The only problem I have had the past few weeks is that when I click on the ""to do"" tab it will say it's empty even though luckily I already know that I still have assignments that are due. So when it says that it's empty, it is extremely misleading. Hopefully it will be fixed. Other than that I think the app is great! I use it everyday."

Recently the app keeps opening up the wrong assignment and it has happened for several weeks. Also every time I attempt to add to the discussion in reply and then I do further research on chrome, it shuts down the app and I lose everything I had typed. Even split screen didn't help. It needs some bugs fixed."
16 April 2018,Michael Fulcher," Mostly good. Would prefer to be able to open external links with a browser 
like Chrome."
12 April 2018,A Google user, The notifications are not pushed. Highly frustrating!
11 April 2018,Alison Tildesley, Was working well but all of a sudden no replies on the discussikn board display. Which means it's missing a vital section. Also when you select one module it jumps to a different one and then you have flick through to find the one you wanted
10 April 2018,Derek Jennings, It does not allow you to copy or paste. I need to turn in essays when I get out late for work and it would be helpful to copy from my docs and paste them in discussions or assignments through this app.
9 April 2018,Jacob Vose," Decent app other than a bug with the push notifications. When toggling discussion post notification responses off, I still receive notifications on my phone from discussion threads."
6 April 2018,Gabby Sommerville," The files are all messed up. The content isn't matching to the day it was originally posted. Ex: I go to read an article my teacher posted under the 12 of February, yet it shows me an article from the 5th."

4 April 2018,Jake Grate, Provides easy access to view grades but often will randomly redirect you to a different module than the one you clicked on.

This app definitely deserves 5 stars but after the last update it is just very annoying to select one assignment and be brought to a different assignment and then having to use the arrows on the bottom of the screen to find the assignment you are looking for.

18 March 2018,Steven Dolbey, It's a bit clunky and we still can't open links externally. Seriously. Get on that please.
12 March 2018,A Google user," This app is excellent for being assignments. But it does not display your actual grades, only the average of things graded by or on canvas. If your teacher gives you a paper test or assignment, you can't view the grade for it or see your actual grade in the class."

Since the default shows grades based on graded assignments I was under the impression that I had an 97% on one of my fast track classes. It turns out my grade was in the 70% range. I noticed it 2 weeks before my class was done.  I didn't know the couple of missing assignments had such a huge impact because of the way the point system displayed. The what if score feature is nice but it's not near as important seeing your true grades like the professors would see it. I am still going to be able to pass the class with a B but if I knew my true grade sooner, I would have made sure all my other assignments were completed to maintain my A+."
25 February 2018,Ben Waga, It's great and helps me keep up-to-date with all my school work. The recent redesign is terrible and makes things even harder to find. It takes sometime getting use to but it's still trash user experience. For that it loses a star.

And when I get notifications and click on them it doesn't take me straight it. It only opens the app. If those 2 things are fixed I would give it five stars. It is a good and helpful app to have.

I also tried on the computer and it would let my select my class names at one time. It made me do it one at a time and still didn't allow me to attach attachments
26 September 2017,Erika De Leon, Attaching files is not working. I also cant use reply
25 September 2017,Ben Riggle, This app is still has a few bugs

Most of the time, tapping on a Canvas notification in your notification pane does not load that notification, but just opens the app to the first screen.

12 June 2017,Larry Boustead, For the most part I find this app works well. The only thing I don't like is you can't back step in discussion posts. You actually have to close out and start over.

19 September 2015,Joie de Vivre,Notifications I don't like how when I click on the notification it doesn't take me to the right place.
16 September 2015,Teslax Phoenix,Was fine before the update But now I can't even open my sent files anymore or see the comments my teacher has made on them.
16 September 2015,Bianca B,"Not too bad I do like this app with the convenience of notifications when an announcement or file is added.

However, when trying to do a quiz on the app, it says the page is not available or it says the quiz cannot be opened even though others opened it through the website. Otherwise I like the app. Just a few things that need to be fixed to make it easy and better for students."
15 September 2015,Erik Jacobsen,"Progress is good The app has really improved a lot.  I can't seem to add entries into modules,  though.

Also,  and this seems to have happened recently,  files I upload are always renamed to ""File_Upload"" which is not very convenient. Update: Some nice improvements. I am still having issues with file uploads: they all go into an ""unfiled"" folder (which is created if it doesn't exist) as opposed to the current folder you are viewing."
15 September 2015,Kim Mayfield, Quizzes need to be allowed as well as a better platform it won't allow me to use the next button
15 September 2015,Benjamin Nix,"Just ok. Needs some work My biggest complaint is that when I try to reply to a comment on an assignment, the app force closes. Every. Single. Time."
14 September 2015,Danielle Kim,"No grades I couldn't find my grades anywhere on the app, and that was the only reason why I got it. Everything else seems nice and clean though, still uninstalled."
14 September 2015,Jarrod Frederick,Google Docs I can't use it to turn assignments in because it doesn't have support for google docs.
13 September 2015,Devin Delp, It works but is not as user friendly as the site
8 September 2015,April Davis,"Not a fan of the updates Since the updates, it is more difficult to navigate between classes and assignments.  I do not like that the to-do list does not have a place to mark a task complete."
6 September 2015,Cat C.,"One problem... So, I'm only having one problem since the new updates have taken place. How, on Earth, am I supposed to see ONLY the grades from this semester on my grade widget? It's showing all of the grades from all of my semesters in school using Canvas. I only need this semester's grades."
5 September 2015,A Google user,It's cool The update had ruined the chat which my professor likes to use for class. I have only updated on my galaxy s6 edge...please fix and it'll be a 5 star.
5 September 2015,Lekechia Dickens,Sooo many notifications!! I tried to turn them all off but I'm still getting notifications every 5 minutes! Gonna have to uninstall!
5 September 2015,Jordan Smith,"Canvas I don't like the update, grades disappeared and that is one of the main things i look at."
4 September 2015,Slk the King, Never really liked canvas but but I need it for school
2 September 2015,Abhimitra Alampalli, Bulky and not so user friendly
28 August 2015,Tyler Larson,PLEASE MAKE A CALENDAR WIDGET Your app is getting better and better! I just want a canvas calendar widget and everything would be perfect!
27 August 2015,Ryan Tonkin, Needs document viewer
27 August 2015,95phoebe ish,Sadness The update on my brand new galaxy tablet sucks.... Makes me sad because before the update everything worked smoothly now its just sad slow and not working for me.
20 August 2015,Penni Defrin," It's convenient, but when you want to  email a specific instructor it stinks. If you don't know  their email  address,  it will go to ever instructor  in the dept. It should  offer a drop down of names to select from."
12 August 2015,john dyer, its okay
5 August 2015,Christiaan Colville,"Convenient but not quite there Organization of modules is off and you cant do discussion threads. But if you are just looking to see what the assignment is, you're in luck."
2 August 2015,Grace Sibbitts,"Grade improvement This is pretty nice but when I don't get full marks for a section of my assignment, it doesn't tell me how many points I got. That would make this perfect but I still need to go through the web to find out those ""specifics."""
28 July 2015,Varvara Eckman,"Alright This app works okay sometimes, but it force-quits way too often, and I have lost my work because of this numerous times. Please introduce an auto-save option while typing answers. Also, there is no option to edit or delete a submission from the mobile app, you must use a browser. Frustrating"
13 July 2015,Alex Diaz," It was a great app, but I can't seem to get it installed onto the galaxy 6 edge."
12 July 2015,Andy Picton, How do I leave a group? The quarter ended and I'm still in an old group?
3 July 2015,Tessa,"It's alright, I suppose... The full version is much better though"
1 July 2015,Christina Hill,"It's ok but... It is a nice app but my main problem is, I can not turn in assignments nor can I open the reading assignments. It makes it very inconvenient and harder on me."
1 July 2015,jessicazavala1117,It's peachy It works for school and that's all that matters.
27 June 2015,A Google user,Good But....... Too many updates. I have this on my phone like many others and too much space is being taken up with useless updates.
27 June 2015,Too Whitherward," Nice app, better than blackboard but room for a lot of improvements for a generally more user friendly experience. Keep working on it, it will be great."
26 June 2015,Lizbeth Rivera," Blackboard collaborate link doesn't work, I know it works on th emobile app because i use on the phone/ipad/ipod just doing work on the Android."
25 June 2015,Akeysha Patterson, Wish I could do my discussions on this app but you can't.  When doing daily checkpoints sometimes it tells me that it can't be displayed which is crazy.
21 June 2015,Blaire Dorsey,Was Great When it Worked I used the app for one semester then it was giving me problems so I logged out. I have been unable to get back in for two weeks! Would love to be able to use the app again.
15 June 2015,Rebecca Tegeler,Has problems Constantly says merge behind my class. Won't let me see my messages or assignments. Says there is an unexpected error. Fix please!
11 June 2015,Zoey Brinkerhoff,Problems Every time I click something  it says unexpected  error has occurred  please fix this
10 June 2015,stale cornchips, When I go to take quizzes on my phone it brings me to the regular website which is really tiny to read on thescreen

4 June 2015,Erin Nielsen,"It worked out great It quit working after I logged out on my tablet and now it would not let me back in,google chrome is now saying its not secure"
3 June 2015,Andrey Antonchik,Needs a smoother ui Often times clicking on a pdf won't open in app. It's sluggish. Sending attachments to other students is weird and confusing. Checking grades doesn't allow you to see the average class scores ect. However you guys are working on it and I like the design.
29 May 2015,Shani Nicole,"Groups There are a few features I cant access, one is groups. That would be great"
17 May 2015,Theodora Joannis, Would be great if I could actually be able to access the app when I log in to my school website. Instead it just sends me to the website instead of the app. And then it will say view in app and then say page not available. It's really frustrating.
11 May 2015,Michelle McCracken,Was working great... But now I cannot save my current courses as favorites; and the only courses that keep showing as current are at least two semesters old. Please fix!
9 May 2015,Venecia Webb,"It's Alright I use this app for my graduate school and it works and is very helpful, but it crashes sometimes and somerimes, it doesn't create answer choices for our tests correctly. It is a really good app, just has some tech issues that need to be fixed."
9 May 2015,Quentin Canada,"It's nice, but The app is very convenient and all, but when I try to plug on grades that I need to get to achieve a certain grade the app is incorrect. The website and the app will show two different scores.. This needs to be fixed"
30 April 2015,junior Louis," Unpredictable table as in at time I'm unable to view files like a PowerPoint.  When it does it duties, it is good."
27 April 2015,hassan noor, so far is ok
25 April 2015,Andy Win,Florida state uni Where is fsu ?
21 April 2015,Chris Myers,"I like the access, but it's still pretty limited This would be at least a four star app if you had the ability to search."
15 April 2015,Anees Ahmed,Need multi window support Good app all it needs now is multi window feature for the Galaxy Note devices.
12 April 2015,D james,Discussions Opening them causes app to crash. One of the only reasons i used this app  and now it doesnt work.
10 April 2015,Cindy Conway," Okay, I'm not certain but it might be working now.  I'll increase my rating when I know for certain."
8 April 2015,Kalvin Graham,Discussion Attachments I am only able to post video files and not images. Other than that I love the new discussion format. Keep up the great work.
3 April 2015,Patrick Pinheiro,"Great idea, but crashes a lot! Much better than Blackboard, but it crashes quite a bit; it mostly crashes when opening a class calendar."
2 April 2015,Coriann Ulrich,What happened to the messaging portion? The last time I had canvas in 2014 I was able to send files to my instructors directly from my phone. Now I can't... not too happy with this current version.
24 March 2015,Trenton Faulkner, Its okay
24 March 2015,Scott Glass,It's whatever The main reason I got this app is to get rid of the ad for this app to stop appearing every time I accessed it in my browser.
20 March 2015,Allison Wooten, I updated canvas last night and since then it will not allow me to post in the discussion. It says an unexpected error occurred. HTC one Maxx

17 March 2015,Josh Archer,Room for improvement It could be better if it had notifications that told you when your teacher just posted something
17 March 2015,Austin Bouhebent,"Problems Whenever I type in a discussion group, the text goes white."
16 March 2015,Steve Marsh,"Log in Logged in to my student account and canvas wants access to my personal email account and profile...why. Seems like it is over stepping, just to give ease of use."
11 March 2015,Kassandra Waltenburg,"Does not update. I love the app and widgets, however it doesn't seem to sync with the canvas site. I have to uninstall and reinstall the app again to keep the app up to date with changes from my instructor."

I cannot find any way to view my students grades from the app. When I select ""grades"" from the course I teach, it only shows me that my grade is 0% in the course. So as a student the app is good, but as a teacher its pretty useless."
2 March 2015,rochell dunn,It's okay There's nothing too special about it.
25 February 2015,Ben Cheung,Can't submit assignment Whenever I try to upload a file it instantly returns to the home screen. Hope this is fixed soon!
24 February 2015,Lori Wilke,"Love the idea. Great idea, not yet perfected. Asked me to log in several times, couldn't pull up information from English  resources tab. Was kicked out of a YouTube video on writing and made me log in again. Look forward to updates."
23 February 2015,Rick Obear,"Needs improvement, videos do not work As others have stated the videos do not play. First frame loads, but nothing more. I was able to download PDFs and overall the interface is pretty good."
22 February 2015,Tanvi Kher," Don't really like the layout of the course pages once I've opened them. I prefer the web version better for this. Also, I try to change my profile picture to either a panda avatar or a photo from my gallery but it doesn't change."

17 February 2015,Aulani Spencer,"Can't open pdfs, docs, ppts, or excel files! Canvas keeps telling me that I don't have any applications that can handle the file. I actually have four applications that can open it. The applications on my tablet opened the files before the update and now Canvas gives me this error. This is very inconvenient when I need it for school."
