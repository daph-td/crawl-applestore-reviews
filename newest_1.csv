19 November 2021,Miss Kai, It's good but it really requires really fast internet which is really frustrating. When passing videos it really takes so much time. When it fails it restarts again which makes me angry and frustrated. This app is really pretentious.

8 November 2021,Daniel Bowder," This app offers to let you write a review on Google play, but only if you tell them that you're going to give them a 5 star rating. This is deceptive behavior which means that the reviews on here are skewed toward positive reviews instead of what people actually think of the app."

8 November 2021,Liza Liza," CANVAS is extremely UNintuitive and NOT user-friendly. It's a linear system and quite annoying and time wasting to use.

You have to keep going back to one specific page to go to the page you want. Most of the time you can't find what you are looking because it's not where you'd expect it to be. Also, it gives you no warning when you're about to start a test! If you accidentally press ""next"" there's no way back or out. There should be a permanent link to BRAINFUSE!"
8 November 2021,Ma mingwai, Stick on the log in page and I can't use it.

5 November 2021,Alex Ohannes," Signs me out for no reason after a few days. If this is ""expected behavior"", then add obvious solutions like a pin or fingerprint support and remove the auto logout. There is no excuse for this app logging you out if the desktop version doesn't."
4 November 2021,Bean Mastur," I try to open the assignment, but it just closes the app"
4 November 2021,Eris," If I could give a zero star, I WOULD. A simple passing of an output that's only 1mb‚Äînot even passing 1mb of storage‚Äîrequires a really good connection? If not, you would have to pass it repeatedly? Pray for me the next time my professor ask for a video output. Fix it."

29 October 2021,Swatantra Naskar," Helpless experience! If logged out by any mishap, you will struggle and die to log back in. Probably you will miss your assignment due date. The password reset page or whatever it is, it doesn't work. The password reset page looks like the login page so it is confusing."
